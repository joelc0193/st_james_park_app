1. Flutter SDK: All the files will share the Flutter SDK as a dependency for building the UI and handling user interactions.

3. Message Model: The "message.dart" file will define the Message model. This model will be used in "map_screen.dart", "map_widget.dart", and "message_service.dart" to represent messages that users create.

7. Main Function: The "main.dart" file will contain the main function that starts the application. This function will use "map_screen.dart" to display the initial screen of the application.

8. Map Screen: The "map_screen.dart" file will define the MapScreen widget. This widget will be used in "main.dart" to display the map and messages.

9. Map Widget: The "map_widget.dart" file will define the MapWidget widget. This widget will be used in "map_screen.dart" to display individual users and their messages on the map.

10. User Symbols: The symbols representing users on the map will be shared between "map_screen.dart" and "map_widget.dart".

11. Message Display: The mechanism for displaying messages above user symbols will be shared between "map_screen.dart", "map_widget.dart", and "message_service.dart".
